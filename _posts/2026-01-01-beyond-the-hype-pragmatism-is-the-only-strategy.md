As we close 2025, the noise around AI has been deafening. I have spent the year auditing distressed HR tech projects and rescuing stalled implementations. If there is one lesson to take into 2026, it is this: Pragmatism wins. The "hype cycle" is dangerous. It convinces leaders to buy tools they don't understand to solve problems they haven't defined.

I read the World Economic Forum piece on the forces shaping work, and it resonates with my daily battles. The demographic shifts, the skills scarcity—these are not theoretical problems. They are operational threats. I see companies in Morocco and across MEA rushing to adopt "Generative AI" without having a clean Core HR database. You cannot generate intelligence from chaos.

My strategic advice for the coming year is simple: Return to fundamentals. Audit your data stack. Secure your governance. Train your people not just on tools, but on logic and ethics. Technology is a powerful accelerator, but if you accelerate a bad process, you just hit the wall faster. Be the architect of your transformation, not just a passenger on the vendor's roadmap. Let's make 2026 the year of boring, effective, measurable ROI.
