The greatest friction in corporate learning is the "Alt-Tab" tax. Every time a sales rep has to minimize Salesforce, open an LMS, log in, and find a course, you have lost them. Productivity dies in the browser tabs. The launch of the AI Learning Agent on Salesforce AppExchange is the technical solution to this behavioral problem.

In my years restructuring sales enablement processes, I have found that "Just-in-Time" training is the only training that sticks. If a seller is looking at an opportunity in the Aerospace sector, the system should push relevant industry insights *inside* the CRM opportunity record. This is what Cornerstone is finally delivering. It turns the CRM from a system of record into a system of intelligence.

However, implementing this requires a shift in how we build content. You cannot shove a 45-minute SCORM module into a chatbot window. We need granular, bite-sized data objects—micro-learning that is tagged with extreme precision. The architecture of your content must match the architecture of your delivery channel. If you try to push legacy eLearning through these new AI agents, it will be like trying to stream a 4K movie over a dial-up modem. It won't work. The tech is ready; your content strategy probably isn't.
