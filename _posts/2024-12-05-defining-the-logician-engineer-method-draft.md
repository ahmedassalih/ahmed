As we close 2024, I have been reflecting on the patterns I see across the EMEA market.
The era of "HR as Administration" is dead.
The era of "HR as Marketing" (Happiness Officers) is dying.

We are entering the era of **HR as Engineering.**

I am formalizing my methodology, which I call the **Logician-Engineer Method**. It is not about coding, but about mindset. It is based on 3 axioms:

**1. Truth is in the Data (The Axiom of Evidence)**
Opinions are interesting, but in a boardroom, data is imperative. If you cannot prove it with a number, it doesn't exist. We move from "I think" to "The data shows".

**2. Architecture over Features (The Axiom of Structure)**
A solid, boring system beats a fragile, exciting one. I prefer a clean Excel sheet to a chaotic AI dashboard. We prioritize stability and integration over the latest hype.

**3. Humanity is the Endpoint (The Axiom of Purpose)**
Technology is just the vehicle. If the algorithm reduces human agency or dignity, the design is flawed. Efficiency must serve empathy, not replace it.

In 2025, I will be pushing this standard. We need more Architects, and fewer Administrators.
