I am tired of HR Tech vendors selling "Time Saved". I see it in every pitch deck.
"Our tool saves 2 hours per recruiter per week! That is 100 hours a year!"

**The CFO doesn't care.**

Why? Because "Time Saved" is theoretical money. It is only real money if you fire the recruiter (which you won't, and shouldn't) or if the recruiter guarantees to use that specific hour to generate revenue.

In my P&L roles, I learned one hard lesson: **Distinguish Hard ROI vs. Soft ROI.**

*   **Soft ROI:** Engagement scores, Employee Happiness, Learning hours.
    *   *Result:* You get a polite nod and a "Maybe next year."
*   **Hard ROI:** Reduced Agency Spend, Faster Time-to-Revenue for Sales Hires, Retention of Top Performers.
    *   *Result:* You get a budget.

**The Pivot**

If you want a seat at the Strategy Table, stop talking about happiness. Start talking about Revenue Protection.
Instead of saying "This tool improves onboarding", say "This tool reduces the time-to-productivity of our Sales team by 15%, which equals $2M in additional Q4 revenue."

That is how you get signed.
