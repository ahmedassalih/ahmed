Years ago, as Group CHRO of Royal Air Maroc, I faced the hardest challenge of my career: managing a massive restructuring plan. 1,900 people had to leave the company to save it.

In most consulting firms, this is treated as a linear equation: `Cost Reduction Target - Current Cost = Headcount Reduction`.
They deliver a spreadsheet and leave.

But when you are the one sitting in the chair, you realize that logic fails without humanity. An airline is a complex ecosystem where safety depends on morale. If you break the trust of the remaining employees, your planes don't fly safely.

**The War Room Strategy**

We didn't rely on emails or Zoom calls. We set up physical support cells. We negotiated individually. We looked people in the eye.

My approach was hybrid:
*   **The Backend (Engineering):** We modeled every scenario, every financial impact, every legal risk with extreme precision. Zero error margin allowed on the severance packages.
*   **The Frontend (Human):** Extreme availability. Listening. Dignity.

The result? **Zero operational disruption.** The planes kept flying. The social peace was maintained.

In 2023, I see Tech companies firing people via pre-recorded videos. It makes me angry not just ethically, but strategically. It is incompetent leadership.
You can automate payroll, but you cannot automate dignity. If your Digital Transformation destroys your culture, you have failed as an Architect.
