I am writing this from my base in Casablanca.

Over the last twelve months, I traveled extensively across the EMEA region. From boardrooms in Paris to strategic summits in Dubai, I sat across from CHROs and CTOs. They all shared the same exhausted look.

The hype party of 2024 is over. **2025 was the year we had to clean up the mess.**

As an Engineer and former HR Director, I always tell my clients that mathematics does not care about marketing. In 2025, the math finally caught up with the market.

Here is the true story of our industry last year.

## The Data Swamp

Early in 2025, many clients asked me for "autonomous agents" to run their operations. It was the popular technology of the moment.

I asked them one simple question: **"Show me your data architecture."**

What we found was not a clean lake. It was a swamp. Their old systems were rigid and their data was messy. When they tried to force advanced AI into this old architecture, the system failed.

This was the story of the year. Companies spent millions on AI engines but had no roads to drive them on. I spent my time advising companies on data sanitation rather than new features.

> **We learned that you cannot build a skyscraper on quicksand.**

## The CFO Took Control

The mood shifted in August. That was when the experiments stopped.

I remember a meeting with a Global 2000 company. The HR team presented a pilot for an "Employee Experience Copilot." It looked impressive. Then the CFO leaned forward.

He asked how much this reduced the cost per hire. He asked for the impact on the P&L.
**There was silence.**

An MIT study released last summer confirmed what I saw on the ground. It showed that 95% of AI pilots had zero impact on profit. The projects that survived 2025 were the boring ones. Simple automation saved money. The flashy tools did not.

## The Summer of Risk

Then came the fear.

A massive vendor security breach in June exposed millions of applicant records. It sent a shockwave through the industry.

Suddenly, **"Shadow AI"** became my main conversation topic. In my audits, I found that nearly 20% of employees were pasting sensitive corporate data into public AI tools. They did this because their internal tools were too slow.

With the enforcement of the EU AI Act, leaders realized that AI was not just an asset. It was a legal risk. I spent the second half of the year helping leaders build governance walls.

## The Great Shift

The most profound change was human.

In May, a global tech giant announced they stopped hiring for junior HR administrative roles. Their AI agents were handling 94% of routine inquiries.

For the first time, the company workforce grew, but the HR department shrank. The administrative entry jobs are gone. However, this created a demand for a new profile. **Companies are now desperate for HR Architects and Crisis Managers.**

## The Verdict for 2026

The lesson from 2025 is humility.
The technology is ready. We were not.

In 2026, we must stop chasing buzzwords. We need to go back to engineering principles. We need to clean our data and focus on the P&L.

The magic button does not exist. But for those disciplined enough to build the right architecture, the potential is real.

Let’s get to work.
