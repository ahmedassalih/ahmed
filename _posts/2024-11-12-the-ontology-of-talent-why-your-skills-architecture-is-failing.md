I spent the week mapping data fields for a merger between two telecom giants in EMEA.
It was an architectural nightmare.

Company A tracks "Java" as a Skill.
Company B tracks "Software Engineering" as a Role.
Company C (a subsidiary) tracks "Coding" as a Hobby.

When they try to merge their Talent Pools to find hidden gems, the AI sees zero matches.
It concludes: "We have no talent."
In reality, they have plenty of talent, but no common language.

**This is an Ontology problem.**

Everyone wants the "Talent Marketplace" where AI magically suggests the perfect career path.
But nobody wants to do the boring work of Taxonomy.
You cannot buy this off the shelf. Workday or SAP cannot fix your internal semantic mess.

Before you buy a Talent Marketplace, you need a common language. It takes months. It requires workshops. It is tedious.
But without it, your shiny new AI is blind.
