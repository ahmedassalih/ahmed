I was reviewing the hiring plan for a client in Casablance today.
They decided to cut 50 "Junior Analyst" positions. "The AI does the reporting now," they explained proudly. "We only need Seniors to check the output."

It makes financial sense for the Q3 2024 spreadsheet. But it is a strategic disaster for 2030.

**The Apprentice Dilemma**

If you kill the entry-level jobs, **how do people learn?**
Senior Architects don't grow on trees. They are Juniors who made mistakes, fixed Excel sheets, and cleaned data for 10 years. That "boring work" was their training ground.

If we automate the "learning by doing", we are burning the ladder behind us. We are creating an "inverted pyramid" demographic: a heavy top layer of aging experts and no one coming up to replace them.

**The Solution: The New Junior Role**

We need to redesign the career path immediately. The "Junior" of tomorrow shouldn't be a data-entry clerk. They should be an "AI Supervisor".
Instead of doing the work, they should be trained to *audit* the work of the machine.
If we don't fix this pipeline now, we will face a massive leadership void and wage inflation in 5 years.
