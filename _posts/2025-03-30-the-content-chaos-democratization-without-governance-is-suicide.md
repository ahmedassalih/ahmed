A client recently asked me to "turn on" content creation for all their managers. They wanted speed. They wanted agility. I told them they were asking for digital pollution. The integration of tools like Easygenerator into the Cornerstone Galaxy platform is a double-edged sword. On one side, it empowers subject matter experts to create training without needing an instructional design degree. This is the "speed" side of the equation.

However, as an architect who cleans up after failed implementations, I look at the "scale" side. When you allow 5,000 employees to generate content using AI-powered authoring tools, you are not building a library; you are building a landfill. The strategic partnership announced this March is powerful, but only if you have a rigorous governance framework in place. AI makes content creation trivial. That means the value shifts from creation to curation.

Without an automated validation layer—an architectural check that ensures tags, metadata, and relevance—your shiny new Learning Management System becomes a swamp of duplicate, low-quality content. My advice to C-levels is always the same: Do not unlock these AI creation tools until you have defined the taxonomy that will organize the output. Technology like this requires a "Commando" execution speed, yes, but it also requires a "Guardian" mindset for data integrity. Otherwise, you are just scaling noise.
