We were promised that AI would replace HR Directors by 2024.
It is now 2026, and the reality is different.

AI didn't replace humans. It replaced mediocre processes.
But it created a silent killer in the EMEA region: **Architectural Debt**.

### The Silent Killer

I see it every week with my clients. Companies have stacked Generative AI tools like Lego bricks, without thinking about the foundations. 
The result? We have very intelligent chatbots connected to very "dirty" Data Lakes.

### Logic Before Magic

As an Engineer turned HR Leader, I apply a simple rule: **Logic before Magic.**
Before buying the next Copilot, ask your CTO these 3 questions:

1.  **Ontology:** Is our HR data standardized across all 22 countries?
2.  **API Strategy:** Do our systems talk to each other in real-time, or via batch files?
3.  **Governance:** Who owns the output of the AI?

If you can't answer these, stop the pilot. Fix the architecture.
