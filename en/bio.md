# The Engineer in the Boardroom

I operate at the rare convergence of **Engineering**, **HR Leadership**, and **Business Strategy**.

Most consultants speak one language. I speak three:
*   **The Code:** Deep Tech, Data Architecture, AI Governance.
*   **The Board:** P&L, ROI, Risk Management.
*   **The People:** Culture, Crisis Management, Social Relations.

### Timeline of Authority

**2023 - Present | Regional Director, HR Transformation MEA @ Sopra HR**
Partnering with C-Suite leaders to design and deploy HR strategies across the EMEA region. Focus on "Deep Tech" integration and organizational resilience.

**2018 - 2023 | Managing Director & Advisor**
Led digital transformation units, achieving 3X revenue growth and shifting market positioning from "Vendor" to "Strategic Partner."

**The Airline Crisis (Royal Air Maroc)**
As Group CHRO, I managed the full HR spectrum for 6,000+ employees. Successfully executed a massive collective redundancy plan (1,900 departures) with zero operational disruption. This taught me that *Excel sheets don't fly planes—people do.*

**The Foundation | 1996**
**International Mathematical Olympiad.**
My approach to HR is rooted here. In the discipline of competitive mathematics. I treat HR Strategy as an algorithmic problem: it requires logic, precision, and proof.
